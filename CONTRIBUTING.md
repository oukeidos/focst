# Contributing

Thanks for the interest.

## Policy
- **Issues are open** (bug reports, questions, feature requests).
- **Pull requests are closed** and are not reviewed.

## Why PRs are closed
This is a solo-maintained project with limited review capacity.
To keep expectations clear and avoid unreviewed PRs, external PRs stay closed.

You are welcome to **fork** the project and maintain your own changes.

## How to file a useful issue
For bug reports, please include:
- version and commit (if known)
- OS and runtime environment
- exact command you ran
- error message (text only)
- expected behavior vs actual behavior
- minimal steps to reproduce (if possible)

## Privacy and attachments (important)
- Do **not** upload raw user data or generated artifacts directly.
  - Examples: original subtitle files (`.srt`, `.vtt`, `.ttml`, `.stl`, `.ssa`, `.ass`), translated output files, full transcript text, `*_recovery.json`, `--log-file` JSONL logs, `~/.focst/names/*.json`.
- Do **not** upload secrets or private data.
  - Examples: Gemini/OpenAI API keys, private meeting/class subtitles, names/contact details in subtitle text, internal/company-only content.
- If needed, share only a **small, redacted text snippet** that is enough to explain the issue.
- For reproducibility, prefer a **minimal synthetic sample subtitle** over real content whenever possible.

## Notes
- Responses and fixes are **not guaranteed**.
- Security issues: do **not** post publicly; contact the maintainer privately if a security contact is provided.
